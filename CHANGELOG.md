# Changelog

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-23

### New features

#### `ragclaw db info get` — read KB metadata from the CLI

A new read-side companion to `db info set`. Displays the description and keywords stored on a knowledge base:

```bash
ragclaw db info get                       # reads the "default" KB
ragclaw db info get --db my-docs          # named KB
ragclaw db info get --db my-docs --json   # machine-readable output
```

Plain output shows `(not set)` for absent fields. `--json` returns:

```json
{ "name": "my-docs", "description": "Project X API docs", "keywords": ["api", "auth"] }
```

#### `rag_db_info_get` MCP tool

AI agents can now read a knowledge base's description and keywords directly via the MCP server — useful for confirming metadata after a `rag_db_info` write, or for agents that need KB context before routing a query:

```
rag_db_info_get({ db: "my-docs" })
→ { "name": "my-docs", "description": "Project X API docs", "keywords": ["api", "auth"] }
```

#### `rag_list` — KB metadata header

The `rag_list` MCP tool (which lists indexed sources) now prepends a description/keywords header to its output. Agents calling `rag_list` receive KB context alongside the source paths, removing the need for a separate `rag_db_info_get` call before listing.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-21

### New features

#### MCP server — migrated to `McpServer` with Zod schemas

The MCP server now uses the modern `McpServer` API from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` instead of the deprecated low-level `Server` class. All tool input schemas are defined with Zod, giving full runtime validation and accurate JSON Schema generation for every MCP tool exposed to AI assistants.

#### Dynamic version reporting in MCP server and all plugins

The MCP server and all three official plugins (`ragclaw-plugin-obsidian`, `ragclaw-plugin-github`, `ragclaw-plugin-youtube`) now read their version at runtime from their own `package.json` via `createRequire`. This mirrors the existing pattern in the CLI and ensures the reported version is always correct after any package bump.

#### E2E test suite

A new end-to-end test suite covering the full CLI surface (20 tests) was added under `e2e/`. A dedicated CI lint job was also introduced to enforce Biome rules on every pull request.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-21

### New features

#### Web crawler (`ragclaw add --crawl`)

You can now crawl an entire website and index every reachable page in one command:

```bash
ragclaw add --crawl https://example.com/docs
```

New flags on `ragclaw add` (and the `rag_add` MCP tool):

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--crawl` | — | Enable BFS crawling from the given URL |
| `--crawl-max-depth <n>` | `3` | Maximum link-follow depth |
| `--crawl-max-pages <n>` | `100` | Hard cap on pages indexed |
| `--crawl-same-origin` | `true` | Stay on the same hostname |
| `--crawl-include <patterns>` | — | Comma-separated URL path prefixes to allow |
| `--crawl-exclude <patterns>` | — | Comma-separated URL path prefixes to skip |
| `--crawl-concurrency <n>` | `3` | Parallel in-flight requests |
| `--crawl-delay <ms>` | `200` | Polite delay between requests |
| `--ignore-robots` | `false` | Ignore `robots.txt` rules |

The crawler respects `robots.txt` by default, normalises URLs to avoid duplicates, and filters to same-origin links unless `--crawl-same-origin false` is passed.

#### Knowledge base merge (`ragclaw merge`)

Merge one SQLite knowledge base into another without re-indexing from scratch:

```bash
# Merge remote.db into the default KB (strict — embeddings copied verbatim)
ragclaw merge remote.db

# Re-embed all imported text with the local model
ragclaw merge remote.db --strategy reindex

# Preview what would change without writing anything
ragclaw merge remote.db --dry-run

# Conflict resolution
ragclaw merge remote.db --on-conflict prefer-remote

# Selective import
ragclaw merge remote.db --include docs/,wiki/
ragclaw merge remote.db --exclude tmp/
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--strategy <s>` | `strict` | `strict` (copy embeddings) or `reindex` (re-embed locally) |
| `--on-conflict <r>` | `skip` | `skip`, `prefer-local`, or `prefer-remote` |
| `--dry-run` | — | Show a diff without writing anything |
| `--include <paths>` | — | Comma-separated source path prefixes to import |
| `--exclude <paths>` | — | Comma-separated source path prefixes to skip |

Each merge is recorded in a `merge_history` table inside the target database. The `rag_merge` MCP tool exposes the same functionality to AI assistants.

#### Offline model pre-download (`ragclaw embedder download`)

Pre-fetch embedding model files before going offline or before a CI/CD pipeline runs:

```bash
ragclaw embedder download nomic
ragclaw embedder download --all
```

Models already present in the local cache are silently skipped. The command exits with code `1` if any download fails, making it safe to use in scripts.

### Bug fixes

- **CLI version flag** — `ragclaw --version` now reads the version from `package.json` at runtime instead of a hardcoded string.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-20

### New features

#### Embedder plugin system

The core engine now supports a full embedder plugin abstraction. Embedders are loaded as external npm packages (`@emdzej/ragclaw-embedder-*`) and configured via `.ragclawrc.yaml`. Built-in presets (`nomic`, `minilm`, `bge-small`, `bge-base`) are supported out of the box.

- Store metadata records which embedder produced the vectors, and the system warns (or errors) when a mismatch is detected at query time.
- Dimension-aware storage ensures vector column widths adapt to the chosen model.
- `ragclaw embedder list` shows all installed presets with their status.

#### System requirements checker (`ragclaw doctor`)

`ragclaw doctor` inspects the runtime environment and reports:

- Node.js version compatibility
- Available system RAM vs. embedder requirements
- `sqlite-vec` native extension availability
- Plugin load status

RAM detection uses available RAM (free + reclaimable cache) on Linux, giving accurate readings inside containers.

#### Auto-loading `sqlite-vec`

The `sqlite-vec` native extension is now auto-loaded from the `sqlite-vec` npm optional dependency when present, with a clear warning if it is absent rather than a cryptic crash.

#### Configuration system

A YAML-based configuration file (`.ragclawrc.yaml`) supports:

- Custom data directory paths
- Embedder preset selection per knowledge base
- Plugin enable/disable
- Config guards and CLI `ragclaw config get/set/list` subcommands

#### Security and robustness hardening

- Database names are sanitised to prevent path traversal.
- SHA hashing uses a streaming implementation to handle large files without loading them fully into memory.
- Plugin-level size limits prevent runaway indexing of oversized sources.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-20

### New features

#### Test suite (tier 1–3)

Comprehensive Vitest test coverage was introduced across all packages:

- **Tier 1** — unit tests for core utilities (chunkers, extractors, hashing)
- **Tier 2–3** — integration tests for the store, embedder, plugins, and loader

#### Streamable SHA hashing

Internal content hashing was refactored to use a streaming pipeline, enabling efficient change-detection on large files.

#### Initial plugin infrastructure

Foundational plugin loading and the `ragclaw plugin list/enable/disable` commands were introduced, along with the three official plugins:

- **`ragclaw-plugin-obsidian`** — indexes Obsidian vaults via `obsidian://` and `vault://` schemes
- **`ragclaw-plugin-github`** — indexes GitHub repositories, issues, PRs, and discussions via `github://` and `gh://` schemes
- **`ragclaw-plugin-youtube`** — indexes YouTube video transcripts via `youtube://` and `yt://` schemes
